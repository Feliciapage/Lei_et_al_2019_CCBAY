This is Figure 7 in Lei et al with four panels on conditions in Nov 2014 including tidal ellipses in panel b. 

In July 2019, Felicia and JiM converted this routine (including the ellipse function) to be Python 3.7 compatible so there are now two versions of the program: one for 2.7 and one for 3.7.
